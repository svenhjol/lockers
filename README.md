Lockers
===

This is a fork of only the Lockers from BetterStorageToo. (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-storage-too)

The primary intent of this is for personal use; I wanted the lockers, but basically nothing else from BST interested me, and the enchantments in particular insisted on showing up in my villager trades and loot tables. So I took the mod and cut out everything that wasn't a Locker. 

The lockers may see incorporation into svenhjol's Charm ( https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charm ) in the future, and I may be adding variants if that does happen. Nothing else will be added to this mod.
